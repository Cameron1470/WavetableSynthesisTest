Description: A project for testing the possibilities of my audio programming final project, namely wavetable synthesis. First I aim to simply get the synthesis side working with wavetable files being loaded from binary data and an interpolation method will be used for playing this at different frequencies. A linear interpolation is currently being used

I then will try to get it working as a basic synthesizer playing unfiltered signals with a modifiable envelope. A later goal will then be then to implement wavescanning features, multiple wavetables will be loaded an linearly interpolated waveforms will allow for a way to mix between these.

Later goals will be to add filtering and LFO controls
